###### Problem Definition
In todayâ€™s web ad revenue is one of the biggest type of income for most platforms. Therefore, it is also one of the technologies which advances the fastest. Over the past years we have seen how valuable personalized ads are being implemented on every big media platform. There are always new improvements that can be added for this goal. One such improvement is the automation of the personalization of these ads, using AI. 

###### Problem Solution
Using Azure Cognitive services, it is possible to easily implement image recognition features into your program. In our project, we have used the Cognitive Services resource function of Azure in order to select certain images, and find the necessary tags or descriptions for these images using the Azure Cognitive Services API. These results we get can be used to categorize many types of media using image processing in order to push personalized ads towards the consumer.
